There isn't a day by where I don't get help on the internet. People are so good at writing good tutorials and guides, it amazes me how much I can learn from those smart people that made so much research before I did. For example [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is filled with people that are passionate and willing to help and you rarely find a snippet that is as helpful as the one they posted.

But recently learning a new language and also coming from a popular ecosystem like Javascript, I found the lack of some language usage among the developers to be a problem. Discovering Rust is a great example of this.
Even though I've never loved learning a new language as much as I did with Rust and even if the [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and the [cookbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/) are such great resources that it is one of the first time that I've actually read one of these, its lack of community can sometimes be a bit of a challenge.
Tutorials and guides, when they exist, are great, but often lack on specific topics that are covered in other languages. 
For example, password encryption is a topic hugely covered in NodeJS and other web oriented frameworks, but sadly too rarely documented in Rust.

With this blog I hope to share some of the problems I've come across and the respective solutions I've found.
