title: 'Reverse-engineering the Paris-area public transport network'
excerpt: 'Despite having one of the most advanced public transport networks in the world, the RATP (responsible for the Paris metro, RER, tramways, buses, etc.) has always delivered a poor experience to its users. This is due to a lack of transparency and a lack of data. In this article, I will explain how I reverse-engineered the RATP private API to build a better experience for myself and others, and how reverse-engineering can be used to improve your daily life.'
